## THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION

### The Problem
Your sticky header logo overlaps with your page content as users scroll. It looks sloppy, unprofessional, and distracts from your beautiful design.

### The Solution
Logo Collision intelligently detects collision zones and triggers gorgeous GSAP-powered animations to gracefully move your logo out of the way—then smoothly returns it when safe.

## EFFECTS SHOWCASE

### 7 Premium Animation Effects

**1. Scale**
Subtle and professional. Your logo elegantly shrinks away during collisions and smoothly scales back.

**2. Blur & Fade**
Modern and sophisticated. Apply a soft blur effect with optional scaling for a dreamy transition.

**3. Slide Text**
Perfect for text logos. Your logo slides up or down to avoid content gracefully.

**4. Text Split**
Dramatic and memorable. Characters scatter in different directions with staggered timing, then reassemble.

**5. Character Shuffle**
Playful and engaging. Characters scramble and shuffle before revealing themselves again.

**6. Rotation**
Dynamic and eye-catching. Your logo rotates and moves simultaneously for maximum visual impact.

**7. Move Away**
Clean and minimal. Logo slides horizontally off-screen, returning smoothly when clear.
